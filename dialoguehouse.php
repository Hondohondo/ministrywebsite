    Organizing and coordinating approximately 150 public Intensive Journal workshops annually. We offer introductory programs as well as the advanced modules. Extended programs offer participants an opportunity to experience the full method in a continuous experience. Programs are offered year-round both in the United States, Canada and overseas.

<h2 class="heading-two">Continuing Education</h2>

<p class="para">
    We are an approved provider of continuing education to counselors and social workers. Professionals begin to learn Progoff’s theories of growth through a direct experience in their own lives in a workshop setting. The Intensive Journal method is an important resource to complement the counseling process.

<h2 class="heading-two">
    Social Service programs
</h2>

<p class="para">
    The Intensive Journal method can be used effectively by participants with only a modest level of education. We offer workshops in the following settings:
</p>
<p class="para">
    Criminal Justice. The Intensive Journal method can transform offenders in a deep and long-lasting way as they find answers about life for themselves. Improved behavior and changed attitudes results in less violence, reduced recidivism, and greater possibilities for becoming a constructive member of society.
</p>
<p class="para">
    Family Services. People who have faced traumatic experiences (e.g. rape or domestic violence) have used the Intensive Journal method to rebuild their lives. The method connects a person to their underlying capacities in a non-threatening way.
</p>
<p class="para">
    Job training. Trainees attend Intensive Journal sessions while they are being trained in entry level positions. Our program contributes to improved attitudes leading to higher rates of completion, job performance and promotion.

    Dr. Progoff authored 14 books on the Intensive Journal method, depth psychology, meditation, C.G. Jung’s theories, and mysticism. Progoff’s audio materials provide an effective way to learn more about his unique theories of self-development and benefit from Entrance Meditation™ readings.

<h2 class="heading-two">
    Fund-raising
</h2>

<p class="para">
    Tax-deductible contributions are an important way that we can continue to offer these services. Progoff established a separate organization, The Foundation for Integral Research (FIR) to help fund, through tax-deductible donations, the development of his programs and materials in psychology, including the Intensive Journal program. Contributions are most welcome. FIR's 501(c)(3) status is inactive so donations are not presently deductible.
